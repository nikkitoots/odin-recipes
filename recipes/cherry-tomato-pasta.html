        <h1> Cherry Tomato Pasta </h1>

        <p><strong>Cherry tomato pasta</strong> is one of my favorite dish to have in most of the summer. It has a fresh, light, and vegan sauce that comes out silky smooth with a nice balance of sweetness and tanginess from the tomatoes. Once you’re done assembling the Pasta with Cherry Tomatoes, 
            you can keep it vegan or add some shaved parmesan cheese when serving. </p>
        
            <p> This pasta is easy to make and can be cooked in 15 minutes!</p>

            <h4> INGREDIENTS</h4>

            <ul>

            <li><strong>8</strong> ounces spaghetti</li>
            <li><strong>1/4</strong> cup olive oil</li>
            <li><strong> 2 </strong>pints cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li> <strong> 3 </strong>garlic cloves <em>minced</em></li>
            <li> <strong>1/2</strong> tsp salt</li>
            <li><strong>1/2</strong> tsp <em>crushed red pepper</em></li>
            <li> <strong>1/2</strong>cup fresh basil</li>
            <li><strong>1/4</strong> cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
    
            </ul>

            <h4> INSTRUCTIONS </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook 
                    pasta until al dente according to package directions. 
                    Reserve ½ cup pasta water and drain</li>
                    <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the cherry tomatoes and cook until softened, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, salt and crushed red pepper and cook until fragrant, 1 more minute. Use the 
                        back of a spoon or a potato masher to carefully mash 
                        the tomatoes to release their juices. 
                        Continue cooking until the tomatoes continue to burst 
                        and create a sauce, 5 more minutes. </li>
                        <li>Transfer the drained pasta on top of the tomato 
                            sauce along with the basil and parmesan cheese and toss to combine. 
                            Add as much of the reserved pasta water as needed to reach the desired consistency.</li>
                            <li>Serve immediately with more fresh basil and parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
            </ol>
